------------------------
Note: For privacy policy of GitHub and OpenAI, I can not upload .env file which contains the API Key.

I followed the "Developer quickstart" from the OpenAI wibsite.

Step 1: Install the OpenAI Python library

       pip install --upgrade openai

Step 2: Set up  API key:

I create my own API key so I can use it later.

In my project I create a file ".env" file which contains my API key like this:

    OPENAI_API_KEY= # here I put my key.

In i.gitignore file just write:

      .env

Step 3 (Updated): Interacting with ChatGPT:
